    <h2>The Best Lasagna Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      This is one recipe my husband begs me to make. He is obsessed with this
      lasagna and if he is stressed or overwhelmed with work, this is what I
      make him. It is the perfect comfort food meal! Thereâ€™s something so
      amazing about homemade, made-from-scratch lasagna. Whenever he orders beef
      lasagna at a restaurant, he ends up disappointed. This is such a warm,
      comforting dinner and can feed a crowd (or at least a lot of hungry kids).

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
      <li>1 small Onion (finely diced)</li>
      <li>1 lb. Lean Ground Beef</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon Garlic Powder (or 5 garlic cloves, finely minced)</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon Pepper</li>
      <li>
        32-40 ounce jar Marinara Sauce (may use more depending on how "saucy"

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over
        medium heat. Add onion and cook for about 3-4 minutes. Add ground beef
        and increase heat to medium-high. Cook until the meat begins to brown,
        about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

      <li>
        Spread the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking pan with 1/4 cup of the meat sauce.
        Place 3 noodles in a single layers on top of the sauce. Spread each
        noodle with parmesan ricotta cheese filling and sprinkle with 1 cup of
        mozzarella cheese and meat sauce. Repeat. Finish with remaining
        mozzarella cheese.

        Spray a large piece of foil with non-stick cooking spray and cover the
        lasagna. Bake for 15 minutes and then remove the foil. Continue to bake
        until the cheese if bubbling, about 25 minutes longer. Cool the lasagna
        for 10 minutes before cutting into pieces.
