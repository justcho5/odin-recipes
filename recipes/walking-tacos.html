    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Walking Tacos are small bags of corn chips like Fritos filled with taco or
      nacho toppings. Each bag is meant to be an individual portion that is
      portable—hence "walking." The bag is the perfect vessel for holding
      toppings like ground beef with taco seasoning, tomatoes, lettuce, cheese,
      or whatever you love on your tacos. It's not meant to be a meal (though
      why not?) but a tasty post-school snack or party treat. Dig in with a fork
      or your fingers, which will be messy and that's half the fun.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground beef (80/20)</li>
      <li>1 large white onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups), divided</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce) can pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
      <li>
        1 (1-ounce) package taco seasoning or 2 tablespoons Homemade Taco
        Seasoning
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup salsa (any kind)</li>
      <li>8 (3.5-ounce) bags corn chips, such as Fritos</li>
      <li>2 cups finely shredded romaine lettuce</li>
      <li>8 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 large tomato, chopped</li>
      <li>1/2 cup tender cilantro stems and leaves</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
      <li>Pickled jalapeños and hot sauce, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the ground
        beef, half of the chopped onions, and salt, and cook, stirring
        occasionally, until the onions are soft and the beef is cooked through,
        about 5 minutes. You can scoop out the fat if you'd like.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lower the heat to medium-low and add the pinto beans, taco seasoning,
        and salsa and cook, stirring occasionally, until the beans are warmed
        through, about 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use scissors to cut either the top off or cut down the center front of
        each chip bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        To assemble each bag: Spoon about 1/2 cup beef on the chips, and top
        with 1/4 cup lettuce, 1/4 cup cheese, 2 tablespoons tomato, 1 tablespoon
        chopped onions, 1 tablespoon cilantro, and 1 tablespoon sour cream.
      </li>
      <li>
        Garnish with pickled jalapeños and hot sauce. Serve immediately. The
        chips will get soggy if assembled ahead of time.
      </li>
    </ol>
